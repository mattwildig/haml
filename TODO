Hey, weird pull request, but: I wanted to introduce this to you, in case you had need for it:

https://github.com/shaiguitar/haml-i18n-extractor

It's essentially a library/tool for extracting out i18n text out of haml, by parsing it with the haml nodes/types.

If you can use this, or know anyone who can use this, please let them know and give it a whirl. I would be happy to get feedback. Thanks!
